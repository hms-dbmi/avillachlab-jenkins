# Overview

Welcome to the base folder of your Jenkins project. This folder contains two subfolders, each dedicated to a specific aspect of your Jenkins infrastructure: `jenkins-docker` and `jenkins-terraform`. Below, you'll find an overview of each component along with links to their respective README files for detailed information.

## Jenkins Docker (`jenkins-docker`)

This section focuses on the Dockerization of Jenkins, incorporating additional tools and configurations to enhance its functionality. The Jenkins Docker image is extended from the official LTS image, making it a versatile and powerful solution. For more information, refer to the [Jenkins Docker README](jenkins-docker/README.md).

## Jenkins Terraform (`jenkins-terraform`)

Here, Terraform is leveraged to deploy and manage Jenkins infrastructure on AWS. The README provides insights into the variables, backend configuration, and outputs defined in the Terraform files. Detailed information about variables, Terraform backend configuration, and outputs can be found in the [Jenkins Terraform README](jenkins-terraform/README.md).

Feel free to explore each component to understand their configurations, usage, and any additional details you may need for managing your Jenkins environment efficiently. If you have any questions or need assistance, don't hesitate to reach out.
